#Your village is being attacked by 'a germanic tribe' and you need to run to the stores and get the right things
# to save your village, and probably some good looking girl or boy you want to marry.
# All prices in gold pieces excl. VAT... chop chop!! ze germanz are coming!
#The code should allow you to get 1 thing from each store and each item you get should be removed
# from the store inventory, then do same for next store...
# one way to buy by typing the key 'newt' in an input box...or something
# at end you should print the 'items' you have taken..in this version you don't have to pay for stuff or add it up
